on this repository.

Include:

- Affected versions/commits

We will acknowledge your report within **72 hours** and aim to release a fix
within **7 days** for critical issues.

## Scope

This project is a **library crate**. Relevant vulnerability classes:

- Denial of service via pathological input (excessive CPU/memory in world generation)
- Memory safety issues (should be none — the crate enforces `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`)

Out of scope: game logic bugs, upstream dependency issues (report those to the
dependency maintainer directly).
